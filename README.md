# Bouncing Dots – Butano (GBA)

This mini-project creates multiple bouncing dots using the Butano engine for Game Boy Advance.  
Each dot moves in two dimensions and bounces off the edges of the screen.

This assignment demonstrates:
- Object-oriented design using a `Bouncer` class
- 2D movement using independent x and y velocity
- Screen boundary collision
- Randomized movement speeds
- Light blue Background color

## Controls

- **A Button** → Spawn a new dot  
- **B Button** → Print the average X position of all active dots  
## Features

- Each dot:
  - Has random `x_speed` and `y_speed`with random speeds (2–4)
  - Moves in two dimensions
  - Bounces on all screen edges

## Engine

Built using:
- **Butano** GBA Engine  
- Tested in **mGBA**
